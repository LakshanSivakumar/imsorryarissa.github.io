                I'm not sure if you would find this apology sincere, but everything about this apology, and this website is really after days of regretting my mistakes, and guilt, and learning from all my mistakes.

                <br> <br>I am deeply sorry for hiding the previous relationship I had. It was stupid, and immature of me to do that. I had always preached about communication with you and wanted you to be honest with me, however I myself did not reciprocate it. It was extremely wrong of me to have been hiding something like this while expecting you to be fully honest with me. You are right to say that I am a different person from who you fell in love with, because the man you fell in love with would have never hid it. That man in me, never wanted to hide it from you, but the other side of me kept it hidden. It was always a battle between these 2 sides if I should come clean to you about it, however you found out before I could tell you. That does not warrant an excuse for me to hide, and I really am extremely regretful of what happened. When we got together, I promised to you that I would never hurt you. However I did, and I am extremely sorry for hurting you. Seeing you hurt and especially by me makes me so sad, and I could never recover from the guilt that I face for treating you like this. I always talked about how I loved you, and how I never looked at any other women in my life, but I understand why you doubt that now. The fact that I hid something so huge from you meant that I could have hidden so many other things during our relationship and I get why you do not trust me anymore. So, I really do understand why you cannot see me as the same person anymore.<br> 


                <br> Now that we are broken up, and back to square one I want to be able to do things right again this time. Of course since we are friends, I will try my utmost best to not overstep boundaries and give both of us space to heal and recover from what happened. I will slowly rebuild the trust you once had in me, as the man you loved is still here typing this apology to you. I'll reduce the really difficult and emotional questions that I keep asking you, and I'll focus on just loving you. I will focus on myself as well, and continue to improve my character and work on my looks more. I truly believe that the greatest form of love I could give you now, is to make myself cute for you and to become the man you loved again. Like i told you multiple times, I will be fully open and honest with you as friends, and also if we do end up getting back together. I do not want to give up on you, and I do not want to give up on us. I truly believe we are soulmates and that god is just testing the strength of our love for each other. 

                <br> <br>I really do love you to the distant stars and back, and I apologise again for betraying the trust you had in me.
